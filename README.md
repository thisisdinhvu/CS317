# CS317: Lab 1 ‚Äì Diabetes Classification Pipeline

This project is part of the **CS317** course and demonstrates a full **machine learning workflow** using **Metaflow** and **MLflow**‚Äîfrom data preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment. The pipeline is designed to be **modular**, **reproducible**, and **scalable**, supporting multi-model training and experiment tracking.

---

## üîç Overview

We tackle the **diabetes classification** problem using multiple machine learning models. This project showcases:

- üîÅ **Multi-model training** with hyperparameter tuning via `GridSearchCV`.
- üìà **Experiment tracking and versioning** with MLflow.
- üßπ **Step-wise pipeline orchestration** using Metaflow.
- üìä Automatic saving of evaluation artifacts like **confusion matrices** and **classification reports**.
- üß± **Modular design**‚Äîeasily add new models or metrics.

---

## üß† Pipeline Structure

Built using [Metaflow](https://docs.metaflow.org/), the pipeline consists of these stages:

1. ### `start`
   - Initializes the pipeline.

2. ### `load_and_preprocess`
   - Loads and cleans the dataset.
   - Applies feature scaling and splits data into train, validation, and test sets.

3. ### `train_models`
   - Trains the following models with `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning:
     - Random Forest
     - Logistic Regression
     - K-Nearest Neighbors
     - Decision Tree
   - Logs all models and parameters to MLflow.

4. ### `validate_models`
   - Evaluates models on the validation set using F1 Score for comparison.

5. ### `test_models`
   - Evaluates final models on the test set.
   - Logs accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix to MLflow.
   - Saves visual reports locally and to MLflow.

6. ### `save_models`
   - Saves trained models to disk using `joblib`.

7. ### `end`
   - Prints a summary of results for all models.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

> **Note**: This project is optimized for **Ubuntu/Linux** systems. If you're using **Windows**, consider using **WSL** or a **virtual machine**.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/thisisdinhvu/CS317
cd CS317
```

### 2. Set Up Python Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv metaflow_env
source metaflow_env/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Docker (if you haven't installed it before)

Follow this guide to install Docker on Ubuntu:
[YouTube: Docker Desktop Setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZyBBv1JmnWQ&ab_channel=CodeBear)

### 4. Set Up Metaflow Environment

Install Metaflow and launch the local development environment:

```bash
pip install metaflow
metaflow-dev up
```

> When prompted, **press `Enter`** to continue setup.

Once ready, go to: [http://localhost:10350/](http://localhost:10350/)  
Wait until all services are marked as **healthy**.

You should see a screen similar to this:

![Metaflow Terminal](https://github.com/truong04/MLOPS/blob/main/image/metaflow-dev-screen.png?raw=true)

### 5. (Optional) Install Conda and Mamba

Recommended for managing dependencies:

```bash
wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
bash Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh
source ~/miniconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh
conda install mamba -n base -c conda-forge
```

Then activate:

```bash
eval "$(mamba shell hook --shell bash)"
mamba activate metaflow-dev
source metaflow_env/bin/activate
```

### 6. Prepare Environment & Install Dependencies

Ensure `metaflow-dev` shell is active:

```bash
eval "$(mamba shell hook --shell bash)"
mamba activate metaflow-dev
source metaflow_env/bin/activate

metaflow-dev shell

# Re-activate environment after entering metaflow shell

eval "$(mamba shell hook --shell bash)"
mamba activate metaflow-dev
source metaflow_env/bin/activate

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Pipeline

Once your environment is ready, run the pipeline:

```bash
python app.py run
```

To view the pipeline in Metaflow UI:  
Visit [http://localhost:10350/](http://localhost:10350/)

To view experiment logs and metrics in MLflow:

```bash
mlflow ui
```

Then go to: [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)

Sample output after running:
